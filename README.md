## About Me
My Name is Simon Jeker. Econ major and BA's in Jazz Composition and Music Synth and Tech, with 12 years of experience writing music for TV and video games. Stay at home dad of 2 kiddos turned into owning and operating a furniture design and build shop for the past 5 years.

Always active in researching trending tech with a strong entrepreneurial spirit I was very active in the stock market over the past 12 years. It also helped to be married to a tech super star witnessing first hand the changes of a 60 employees start-up to a 5000 plus employee public company from an executive perspective.

I'm interested in learning the technical aspect not just getting a deep understanding of coding, but emerging trends and tools to learn about the opportunities and possibilities of this emerging world.

Having a strong interest in economics and finances, FinTech has without a doubt caught my interest.
